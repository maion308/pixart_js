| Completeness        |   3  (out of 3)    |    
| Comfort level       |   5  (out of 5)    |

#### Win:
It took me a while to understand `Array.map`, but once I grasped the callback concept it was smooth as John Coltrane Jazz.  

#### Struggle:
Passing a function as an argument without execution of the function was complex to understand.  

#### Question to instructors:
- Do I have to put the parentheses while passing the function name in the parameters??  

#### Comments:
Loved the lesson, I'm a little bit stuck with resolving promises... some extra material and exercises would help.
